Let me review what we've completed and what might be left to implement for a complete, production-ready plugin:

Completed:
1. ✅ `includes/class-api-client.php` - API integration
2. ✅ `includes/class-product-widget.php` - Widget implementation
3. ✅ `includes/class-settings.php` - Settings management
4. ✅ `fourthwall-products.php` - Main plugin file
5. ✅ `templates/widget-template.php` - Product display template
6. ✅ `assets/css/widget-styles.css` - Frontend styles
7. ✅ `assets/js/admin-settings.js` - Admin JavaScript
8. ✅ `assets/css/admin-settings.css` - Admin styles
9. ✅ `readme.txt` - Plugin documentation

Still needed:
